      "In a bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, and gently fold this mixture into the rice. Allow the rice to cool completely.",
      "Slice the salmon, cucumber, and avocado into thin strips for the fillings.",
      "Lay a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat with the shiny side down. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Place the sliced fish, cucumber, and avocado along the center of the rice.",
      "Carefully roll the sushi using the bamboo mat, rolling it tightly from the bottom edge. Wet the top border of the nori to seal the roll. Use a sharp, wet knife to slice the roll into bite-sized pieces. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger."
